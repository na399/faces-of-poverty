*Currently available in Thai and optimized for desktop screen only*

This is an experimentation with D3.js to draw emojis with different facial components determined by the ranking of poverty from each province in Thailand.

The publicly available data was obtained from [Thai People Map and Analytics Platform](https://www.tpmap.in.th/).

The gridmap layout of Thailand was obtained from [Gridmap Layout Thailand](https://github.com/kristw/gridmap-layout-thailand).

This work was inspired by [The Emoji States of America](https://www.axios.com/the-emoji-states-of-america-1513302318-0ca61705-de75-4c8f-8521-5cbab12a45f2.html).
